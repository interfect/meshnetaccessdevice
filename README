This is the source repository for the Meshnet Access Device, from the Santa Cruz Meshnet Project. It contains (or points to) all the source code you need to build your very own image.

Unfortunately, we haven't yet worked out a build procedure to build from a clean checkout. The Meshnet Access Device is just a specially-configured OpenWRT, with the appropriate packages installed, and OpenWRT's configuration system is designed specifically to keep its configs (and third-party packages) *out* of its git repository.

This repository is probably most useful as a set of commits to look through.
